Much improved since last visit! \r\n 5 Star Review: My brother and I went out for lunch August 24th around 11:30 And I was so impressed with all the staff!! Not only did food come out fast and great quality but the customer service and atmosphere was wonderful too. I also have never seen it so busy. After a table would leave one of the employees would clean off the table and shoot a friendly smile and a “have a good day”Keep doing what you’re doing! We will be back!",

Asked to sub out imitation crabmeat and they missed one. But! They replaced it without being asked and were apologetic. 10/10 will definitely be returning! \r\n 5 stars Excellent rolls. Huge seaweed salad.  Rolls are quite large and difficult to eat. Not many pieces to the shrimp tempura roll but tasty. \r\n 4 stars Come here often and always have great food and service. However beware they are incredibly stingy on sauce when doing take out orders. I had to practically beg to get 2 small containers of sauce... for a $25 meal you shouldn't have to beg for additional sauce.",

We got there at about 6:00pm and had to wait about an hour to be seated, but we went on a Saturday night, so I think that is common. But be aware it is a busy place. We were able to sit at the bar and get a drink, so that was nice while we waited. The bartender, waitress, and all the workers were very nice and accommodating. We had a party of 5. \r\n 5 Star Review: This is the best Olive Garden Italian Restaurant that I've been to.  The dining areas are huge and can accommodate any size party. The menu items are the same, but the portions  are huge Italian style.  I noticed all the staff members were  outstanding with their customers. The bar area filled with laughter and good conversations.  No waiting in line. They have a children's menu that has all the favorite meal combo's  kids want. \r\n 3 stars This was 1 of the most disappointing trips we have had. The food was terrible,  the service was extremely bad.\r\n",
